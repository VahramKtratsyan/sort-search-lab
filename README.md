# sort-search-lab  

This project provides a C++20 framework for implementing and benchmarking sorting and searching algorithms.  
It combines production-ready algorithm libraries with comprehensive performance analysis tools, leveraging modern C++ templates for flexibility, type safety, and code reusability.  
The framework includes both algorithmic libraries and benchmarking utilities, enabling efficient comparison of algorithm performance across various comparable data types.  
                                                             
## Structure 

- **Sorting and Searching Libraries**: Contain classic and modern algorithms implemented with templates, along with utility wrappers that expose consistent callable interfaces.
- **Benchmarking Tools**: A template-based benchmarking library designed for performance measurement and comparison, allowing easy integration of new algorithms or data types.
- **Testing suite**: Verifies the accuracy and correctness of all sorting and searching algorithms before benchmarking.
- **Build System**: Makefile setup that organizes compilation and linking for both algorithm tests and benchmark executables.
